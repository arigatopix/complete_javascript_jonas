FUNCTION (คำนวณ) VS METHOD (เอาอะไรบางอย่างกลับมา)

A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:

A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.

A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the object's prototype.

This is a simplified explanation, ignoring issues of scope etc.

They are called in a similar way; there's not that much difference between them: methods are functions attached to objects (although in JavaScript, functions themselves are objects).


===============

The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
